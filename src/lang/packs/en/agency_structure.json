You can choose the operating language, timezone and change the name, as well as set Default Pay Rates for any work being performed. The Default Pay Rates can be modified later on using many different factors which youâ€™ll define in other pages.",
  "tab_description_1": "If you have divisions within your organisation that have different candidates working there and different members of your staff assigned to them, you need to create Branches. If you don't need this, or your organisation is run from a single central office, click Save & Continue to skip this section.",
  "tab_description_2": "This tool allows you to define different pay rates for different times of the day if you pay your candidates differently for working at different times of the day. You can create segments using the 24 hour wheel. If you don't need this option then just press the Save & Continue to go to the next stage.",
  "tab_description_3": "This page allows you to create Categories - the different types of work that you offer your candidates. You can create an infinite hierarchy of jobs with as many subtypes of jobs as you want. You need at least one type of job to use Realday.",
  "tab_description_4": "This page allows you to divide your pay rates by Area. That might be geographical (you offer better pay in remote locations) or it might depend on the type of work (less renumeration is offered for less demanding jobs). You will also be able to assign your clients and working locations to these Areas. If they aren't any divisions like this in your organisation, just press Save & Continue to skip this section.",
  "tab_description_5": "This page allows you to create different pay rates depending on the candidate themselves - Grades. Perhaps you want to offer better pay to people who have been working with you for a long time, or to candidates who have undertaken training courses. Candidates can also have different Grades for different Categories. If your pay rates don't differ by candidate, just click Save & Continue to skip this section.",
  "tab_description_6": "This page allows you to filter your workers by an additional factor that doesn't have an effect on the pay rate itself. Perhaps you require specific skills for the job, or a specific location, or a specific type of worker. You can create them here and assign them to specific candidates. If you don't use them in your organisation, click Save & Continue to move on.",
